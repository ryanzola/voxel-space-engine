# Voxel Space Engine

This repository contains the source code for a voxel space engine developed using the C programming language and the [DOS-Like graphics](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like) framework during a weekend study project. The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet functional, 3D voxel space engine that allows the user to explore and interact with a voxel-based environment while utilizing retro DOS-style graphics.

DOS-Like is a programming library/framework, designed to recreate the look, feel, and sound of old MS-DOS programs from the early 90s. Instead of running on actual DOS machines, DOS-Like is intended for modern platforms like Windows, Mac, and Linux, enabling developers to create programs with a nostalgic DOS feel.

## Features

- 3D voxel-based environment
- Retro DOS-like graphics using the DOS-Like graphics framework
- Basic camera controls and movement
- Voxel manipulation and rendering
- Procedural generation of terrain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- The DOS-Like graphics framework
  - Available at: [https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like)
